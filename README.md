# UFOs

## Overview of Project
During this project I created a web page with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create tables utilizing Document Object Model (DOM) programming interface based on a given dataset. The users will be able to filter out data using several different filters.

## Results
On this webpage in order to filter the data you will need to do the following:

     *Step 1 Enter in a `date`
     *Step 2 Enter in a `city`
     *Step 4 Enter in a `country`
     *Step 5 Enter in a `shape`
 Doing these steps allow you to filter the data and creates a table.

## Summary
One drawback with this way of creating a webpage is that the littlest miss step or missed place letter can cause the program not to work or display.
One thing I would recommend is that this is one of the better option when you have a huge data set. Another recommedation I would make is build the html code and the js code at the same time so that you are not getting lost on when you need to add and substract area. Always save and check after each add and deletion so you will know where the code was last functioning the way you wanted it to.
