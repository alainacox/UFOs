# UFOs

## Overview of Project
During this project I created a web page with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create tables utilizing Document Object Model (DOM) programming interface based on a given dataset. The users will be able to filter out data using several different filters.

## Results
On this webpage in order to filter the data you will need to do the following:

     *Step 1 Enter in a `date`
     *Step 2 Enter in a `city`
     *Step 4 Enter in a `country`
     *Step 5 Enter in a `shape`
 Doing these steps allow you to filter the data and creates a table.
